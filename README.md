# Color-flipping-game
Since i've recently begun with my web dev journey, i've been trying to get my hands on some small functional vanilla javascript projects to get familiar with the functionalities of css and js.
This is a small color flipper game wherein clicking the switch will flip to some random color.
There's two versions to it, a simple one with only 5 colors and a hex one, with a much larger set, because we're randomly creating hex names of colors.
The main learning here was getting a fair idea of how css and basic javascript works and how we can use DOM elements to make things work!
